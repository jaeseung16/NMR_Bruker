# A collection of python scripts for Bruker TopSpin

These python scripts have been tested with TopSpin 2.16 and TopSpin 3.5pl7.
The latter is the academic free version of TopSpin.
Note that the version of Jython embedded in TopSpin can be different than those tested.

### multifreq.py
Generates a RF shape consisting of multiple frequency components

### radial2D.py
Generates gradient trajectories for radial 2D MRI

### centerout.py
Generates center-out gradient trajectories for 2D MRI

### centerout_reorder.py
Reorder FIDs from center-out 2D MRI experiments so Fourier transform can be performed on TopSpin
